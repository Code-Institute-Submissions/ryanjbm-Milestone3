# Introduction
Hidden Gems is a site made so that people can join the community and share the products that they love to friends, family and strangers. The site labels products under Â£20 as a 'Hidden Gem' and provides people with external links to the products.

This is my third Milestone Project of four towards my Full Stack Software Development Course, throughout this project I utilised HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, as well as Flask, Materialize and JQuery Frameworks to put the whole project together.

# UX

### Goals

* To provide a platform where users are able to upload products along with the image for others too see
* To create an aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate webpage for the user
* To use Interactive and effective features on my website
* Provide a functioning account creation service for users

### Design Process

1. My process began with creating a wireframe on figma, designing my site with initially a blue colour scheme in mind, I settled on a home page, login/register pages, article pages as well as community recommendations page.
1. Throughout my design process my colours used were changed to the following: <br>
  Black (Used for navigation and footer bars)<br>
  Teal (Used for higlight text and most buttons)<br>
  White (Used for navigation text and footer text)<br>
  Black  (Used for general text on the page)<br>
After some experimentation and changes throughout the design and building process these were the colours that I decided look the best, the fonts I used were the following:<br>
  Righteous <br>
  Padauk <br>
  Permanent Marker <br>
1. I made a wireframe for my project using FIGMA. I made the design aesthetically pleasing and made sure it was easy to navigate through. I first made my desktop page and then made my mobile layout. Throughout the process of building my website I made a few changes and additions based off of my experience as well as input from family and friends
1. Some of the changes I made included editing the layout of the page, customising features on the site too

### Testing Devices

### Validating HTML5 and CSS3 code

My code was tested on the WC3 Validation pages and passed all tests

### Different Browsers

I tested my page on the following browsers and found it worked on all

* Safari
* Chrome
* Firefox

### Issues

During my code I had issues with having custom info windows for my Google Maps API and the code for my Read More buttons did not pass the WC3 Validator. These issues were overcome by trial and error with the code myself.

# Deployment

### Deploying

I created my Milestone project using the GitPod environment and pushing it to Github after completing each section, this made sure that my project had good version control in place in case I needed to change some of the work. To create a live version of my project for people to view I did the following:

* Went to my Milestone Project repository on GitHub
* Went to settings and scrolled down to GitHub Pages
* Selected the master branch as source which then gave me the link to include in my ReadMe for people to view
* You can view my project here: [Madrid](https://ryanjbm.github.io/Milestone-Project-2/)

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/ryanjbm/Milestone-Project-2.git into the terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.
