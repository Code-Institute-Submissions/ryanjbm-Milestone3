[Live Project](http://hiddengems-milestone3.herokuapp.com/)

# Introduction
Hidden Gems is a site made so that people can join the community and share the products that they love to friends, family and strangers. The site labels products under Â£20 as a 'Hidden Gem' and provides people with external links to the products.

This is my second Milestone Project for my Full Stack Development Course at The Code Institute, in which I was given the instructions to make an Interactive Front End Project. In creating this website I used CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript.

# UX

### Goals

* To make my Madrid Tourism website provide users with sufficient information about where they should eat and visit in Madrid
* To create an aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate webpage for the user
* To use Interactive and effective features on my website
* Successful use of APIs in the webpage

### User Stories

1. I am a user looking for general tourism information about Madrid
1. I am a user looking for places to eat in Madrid
1. I am a user looking for directions to landmarks in Madrid
1. I am a user who wants to request other specific information about Madrid
1. I am a user wishing to find out information on events taking place in Madrid


### Design Process

1. I began my process by making a plan of how I wanted to layout my website. I came to the decision to do a single page website split into different sections including "Hero Section", "About Section", "Map Section", "Places to Eat & Visit" and a "Contact Form".
1. Throughout my design process I used a simple colour scheme and only a few fonts for my page, the colours I used were: <br>
  #fafafa (Background and some text)<br>
  Black (Most of text and button background)<br>
  Green (USed when hovering over menu items, card info and Map info window)<br>
  Orange  (Used for hovering and clicking buttons on page)<br>
After some experimentation and changes throughout the design and building process these were the colours that I decided look the best, the fonts I used were the following:<br>
  Righteous <br>
  Padauk <br>
  Permanent Marker <br>
1. I made a wireframe for my project using FIGMA. I made the design aesthetically pleasing and made sure it was easy to navigate through. I first made my desktop page and then made my mobile layout. Throughout the process of building my website I made a few changes and additions based off of my experience as well as input from family and friends
1. Some of the changes I made included adding images to separate sections and a few colours and where they are used.

Throughout the process of coding my website and input from other people, a few improvements were made to the website to not only make it look more professional but also to include more useful features.

### Testing Devices

My webpage was tested using Google Developer Tools to see if it's responsive. All devices were tested successfully including Iphones, Samsungs and Ipads of different screen sizes

### Validating HTML5 and CSS3 code

My code was tested on the WC3 Validation pages and passed all tests

### Different Browsers

I tested my page on the following browsers and found it worked on all

* Safari
* Chrome
* Firefox

### Issues

During my code I had issues with having custom info windows for my Google Maps API and the code for my Read More buttons did not pass the WC3 Validator. These issues were overcome by trial and error with the code myself.

# Deployment

### Deploying

I created my Milestone project using the GitPod environment and pushing it to Github after completing each section, this made sure that my project had good version control in place in case I needed to change some of the work. To create a live version of my project for people to view I did the following:

* Went to my Milestone Project repository on GitHub
* Went to settings and scrolled down to GitHub Pages
* Selected the master branch as source which then gave me the link to include in my ReadMe for people to view
* You can view my project here: [Madrid](https://ryanjbm.github.io/Milestone-Project-2/)

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/ryanjbm/Milestone-Project-2.git into the terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.
